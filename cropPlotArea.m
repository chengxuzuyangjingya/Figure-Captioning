% All plots have lines on their x and y axes on the bottom and left
% respectively, but may not have lines for their top and right bounds. For
% bottom and top bound:
% Start at the x-axis location (a coordinate containing all the x-axis
% text labels). Set a range of x coordinates from the right boundary of the
% leftmost x-axis label to the left boundary of the rightmost x-axis label.
% Scan upward until some threshold (95%) of the pixels are nonwhite.
% Continue scanning until this is no longer the case. The first y
% coordinate where this is no longer the case is the bottom boundary, the
% lowest y coordinate to be included in the cropped image.
% This gives us information about the right boundary. In the region above
% the threshold, start from the right and continue right until some
% threshold of pixels are nonwhite; this is the first candidate for
% rightBound. Use the y-coordinate range acquired in leftbound and scan
% left until under the 95% threshold (if we start under it, then don't need
% to move at all, there's no right boundary line.)
